# A reproduction of "A large-scale study on research code quality and execution"

## Introduction

_What is the question asked by the underlying study?_
 * What did the authors learn (claim)?

_Why bother reproducing this?_

According to the latest [ACM Badging Terms][1], "reproduction" is defined as a different team using the same experimental setup, while "replication" is a different team using a different experimental setup. Therefore, this work constitutes a "reproduction" of Trisovic's original work.

_Lay out the other sections._

## Methodology

## Results

## Discussion

### What was easy

### What was difficult

### Communication with the original authors

### What would we do differently if we were redoing our reproduction from scratch?
(or maybe this is part of the first two previous subsections?)

## Conclusion

_Can we reproduce the main claims of the paper?_
* How close can we come?
* Do the differences matter?

### Lessons learned

_How to make more things reproducible?_
* What would we have liked the original authors to have done differently then?
* What would the original authors likely do differently now (based on newer understanding/practices/tools/etc)?
