# A platform for testing computational experiments

## Introduction

_Define "computational experiments", why are they important, why bother reproducing them._

_The result of this work is a software platform. The platform can be used to systematically gather, run, and store the results of computational experiments._

_What is the audience of this software?_

_Lay out the other sections._

## Methodology

_Describe software system. Describe the rationale. Why did we use Dask, etc.?_

## Results

_current count of experiments, count of working experiments, storage cost per experiment, CPU cost per experiment_

_Efficiency := CPU time inside unerlying expeirment / total CPU time._

_Security analysis_

## Discussion

_How easy is it to do a query on the results?_

_Why should people use this?_

_What prior work exists_

## Conclusion

_Is this useful? We think so. What kinds of future research does this enable?_
